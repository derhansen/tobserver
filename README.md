tObserver TYPO3 Extension
=========================

## What does it do?

The tObserver TYPO3 extension is required to enable a TYPO3 website to send data to the
tObserver API. 

## What is tObserver?

tObserver (TYPO3 observer) is a TYPO3 monitoring and management solution, which allows a 
global overview of all your TYPO3 instances. It includes an overview of all installed TYPO3 
core versions, extensions and contains some basic data about the system environment of each
website.
